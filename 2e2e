If I send an Email from my private Mail Account (google) I get this Error:
Delivery to the following recipient failed permanently:

 khitupamarosu271@mailnesia.com
Technical details of permanent failure:
Google tried to deliver your message, but it was rejected by the server for the recipient domain mailnesia.com by mailnesia.com. [162.250.144.109].

The error that the other server returned was:
500 Internal Server Error

Can someone help me to solve this?
